 MNIST Digit Recognition
 
 The MNIST classification task is a classic machine learning benchmark. The data includes 70,000 handwritten grayscale digits, and the task is to identify them. The digits run from 0 to 9 so this is a multiclass classification problem. In particular, there are 10 possible classes.
